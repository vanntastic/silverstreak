== Silverstreak
This is a small php framework... actually more like a collection of files if you will. This
set of files that might be useful if you are under the following situations:

1. Designing a brochure (5-6 page) website and maybe it has a form
2. Don't need a database
3. Using a LAMP Stack
4. Want an easier way to work with the post/get requests and/or forms for that matter

= Features

1. an .htaccess for nice SEO friendly urls, so you can call pages with 'index' instead
   of index.php, this only works on the the main root directory and not any subdirectories
2. stop writing echo all the time, certain methods such as link_to automatically echoes the
   output, so instead of:
   
     <?php echo link_to "Home Page" ?>
  
   you can:
   
     <?php link_to "Home Page" ?>
     
3. nice abstraction methods for checking on request methods and form submitting
4. some form helpers and text helpers...

== Requirements
- Rake (get it at : http://rake.rubyforge.org/)
- Apache (Litespeed works okay though, except .htaccess doesn't work)

== Installation
Just put the silverstreak folder inside a php site like so:

- my_cool_website
  |- silverstreak

1. cd silverstreak
2. rake silverstreak:install
3. it should generate a public folder with all the files that you need in the root of you
   web/project folder, so make sure you point your vhost to my_cool_website/public
4. it will generate a default index.php file for you, on any pages that you setup, make
   sure that the following line is at the top of the page:
   
   <?php include '_init.php'; ?>
   
== Helpers and methods

= link_to 
Somewhat similar to rails' link_to method, this will automatically generate an anchor with
to the page you want it to link to.

  link_to($content='',$href='',$title='');
  
- USAGE

  link_to("Home");
    #=> <a href='home' title='Home'>Home</a> # it works because of the .htaccess
    
  link_to("Home", "index.php");
    #=> <a href='index.php' title='Home'>Home</a>
    
  link_to("Home", "index.php", "Go to Home Page")
    #=> <a href='index.php' title='Go to Home Page'>Home</a>

your partials (pages) with a leading underscore (_) then it will automatically know that 
it is a partial.
